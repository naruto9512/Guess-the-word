# Guess-the-word
It is a simple word guessing game where you get 5 guesses to guess a word. 
There is a list of word here that you can easily edit. 
A random function calls one of the words from the list and then the player is given 5 guesses. 
Players have to guess letters. 
If the player guesses one letter correctly the program will show its location and then he\she would be given a chance to guess the full word and if he\she fails at this point no penalty will be given.
But if the player fails to guess one correct letter in the given word then one guess will be reduced. 
This will iterate through the loop until the player  guesses the word correctly or losses all his guesses and then he/she will be prompted if he/she wants to play again with a simple yes or no answer.
